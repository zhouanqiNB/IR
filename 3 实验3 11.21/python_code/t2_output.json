declining natural gas prices.\n     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,\ntemperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees\nFahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest\ntemperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.\n     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell\n$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.\n     \"What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were\nsupposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the\nweather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.\"\n     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,\nand are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.\n     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the\nEl Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.\n     \"Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices\nto fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.\n     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased\n$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell\nto $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.\n     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant\nwas shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled\nto restart this weekend.\n

Temperatures\ncould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.\n     \"Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of\nthe morning,\" said one PJM-based trader. \"By options expiration\nthe market had pretty much dried up.\"\n     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main\nreason for the decline in spot market prices.\n     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the\nNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million\nBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since\nMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of\n$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts\nindicated reduced utility load requirements.\n     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they\nnormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather\nforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.\n     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13\nhigher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the\n$67.00-$75.00 range.

for peak Thursday power on the\nCincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19\nto $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the\nmarket opened down to $59.00 after options expired.\n     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on\nthe Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower\non average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17\nlower at $65.00-$100.00.\n     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted\nhigh temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal\nin Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven\ndays,
up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.\n     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled\nprices
down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent\nelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired\ngeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.\n     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average\nof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British\nthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average\nof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.\n     \"The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got\npeople coming to their senses,\" one trader said. \"These are much\nmore realistic prices.\"\n     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the\noutlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for\ndelivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00\nyesterday.\n     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged\nwith warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission\ncapacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in\nsouthern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.\n     \"What's happening is the people who don't have firm\ntransmission are getting into the market early and buying at those\nhigh prices
since they have no choice,\" one MAPP trader said.\n     \"Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a\nfirm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices\nfell off,\" he said, \"and bought from them at those lower prices,\ncausing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.\"\n\n-Ken Fahnestock\n\n\nSoutheast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild
Forecast\n\n     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast\nU.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was\nforecast for the region this week, traders said.\n     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since\nmany large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures\nclimb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.\n     \"There was nothing going on in Florida today,\" said one\nsouthern energy trader. \"Everything was going to markets in the\nnorth.\"\n
    Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into\nmarkets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority\ngrid
in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.\n     \"Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as\nforecasts came out,\" said
on Entergy power trader. \"Prices,\ndeclined to $60 and less.\"\n     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95\nto $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades\nwere noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent\nestimates.\n     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather\nforecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week\ncaused prices to decline in the region.\n     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was\nthe main culprit behind lower prices.\n     \"The cold weather's backing off,\" said one SPP utility\ntrader. \"It was minus 35 degrees with the wind
chill yesterday and\ntoday it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was\nbitter cold and today it was just plain cold.\"\n     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though\nthe Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern\nSPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.\n\n-Brian Whary\n\n\n\nU.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand\n\n     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in\nthe U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were
expected to\nincrease household consumption for space heating, traders said.\n     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the\nElectricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01\npounds a megawatt-hour.\n     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees\nto 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services\nCorp. in the U.S.\n     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15\npounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.\n
  December continued to fall amid a combination of position\nclosing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will\nnot rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.\n     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.\n     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with\nexpectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue\nto stifle demand, traders said.\n     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.\n     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.\n     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer\n2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.\nWinter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour.\n     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely\nforce many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-\nup to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will\nprobably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more\neasily be assessed.\n\n-Nick Livingstone\n\n\nNordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast\n\n     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices\non the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today\nas colder
weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.\n     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-\nhour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076\nmegawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446\nmegawatts dealt
between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.\n     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after\nforecasts indicated
reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for\nnext week. These producers typically generate power to prevent\nreservoirs from overflowing.\n     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise\nwith falling temperatures because of increased requirements for\nspace heating.\n     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active\ntrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders\nsaid.\n     \"The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,\" a\nStockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have been\nselling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should\nnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"\n     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall\nbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited\nchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather\nServices Corp. in the U.S.\n     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was\nexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict\ntemperatures to begin falling.\n     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22\npercent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell\n4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.\n     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise\nby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.\n     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-\nterm contracts.\n     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,\n1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a\nmegawatt-hour.\n
    Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although\nexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers\nto meet the increased demand, other traders said.\n     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,\nwill delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.\n     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used\ntoday's
news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.\n\n-Nick Livingstone\n-0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT\n=0F$\n\n\n - daily.pdf"

let me know.\nThen, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?\n\nSan Marcos\nThe property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for\nsale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will\nknow more on this question later today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge W. Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n - winmail.dat"
