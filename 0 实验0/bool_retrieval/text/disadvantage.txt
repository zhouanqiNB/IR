Disadvantages
Exact matching may retrieve too few or too many documents
Hard to translate a query into a Boolean expression
All terms are equally weighted
More like data retrieval than information retrieval
Retrieval based on binary decision criteria with no notion of partial matching
No ranking of the documents is provided (absence of a grading scale)
Information need has to be translated into a Boolean expression, which most users find
awkward
The Boolean queries formulated by the users are most often too simplistic
The model frequently returns either too few or too many documents in response to a user
query
